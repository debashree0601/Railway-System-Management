# Railway-System-Managementt
We can create a railway network database solution to handle train schedules, passenger travel, station information, and more. The system facilitates ticket reservations, train operations, ticket cancellations, pre-departure chart preparation, rescheduling in case of delays, and more.
Functionalities

The system will consist of information about the trains like the train name, number of coaches, train type, and if the train is currently between a journey. This will create a pool of trains from which we can pick available trains to schedule a new journey.
The system will have a schedule table which will keep a record of the schedules of the trains including start time, end time, source, destination, and the route that the train will be taking.
The system will have provision to store the data about passengers who have travelled, are travelling, and are about to travel in future. The basic information of the passengers, along with the train name they are travelling in, coach number, berth number, ticket status, and their respective schedule will be captured.
The system also requires a list of station names that will provide information about each station like the name of the station and the city or state it belongs to.
Finally, there will also be a route information table which provides information about the route that a particular train will be taking between source and destination stations.
